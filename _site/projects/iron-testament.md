<p class = ""> Iron Testament is an upcoming turn-based strategy game that takes place in a post-apocolyptic future. You play as the last human left on Earth after a robot uprising, and leading a fringe sect of life-worshiping robots, you must take back the planet for the Children of Flesh. </p>
<p> Of all my projects, Iron Testament is the one I am most proud of. Not only for how wonderful the game is shaping up to be, but because I played a large role in it coming to fruition. It is the first major project to be made by Rat Economy, a 19-person game studio that I co-founded with friends from the University of Southern California. Alongside my Programming Lead duties, I have helped organize this team and assisted in creating a truly unique, innovative, and community-first approach to game design. I am very proud of what we have made and cannot wait for the world to see it.</p>
